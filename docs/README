This is the IGIBS suite which consists of the following parts:

 + a WSGI web service to provide an interface where:
     i) The user uploads diverse datasets (different types of vectors or rasters in different projections ) as a single zip file
     ii) the resulting properties of the included files are presented to the user where metadata and styling options are edited.
     iii) The URL of an INSPIRE compliant View Service (VS) is presented to the user. This VS can be accessed either form the included WMS mapping application or a desktop GIS client (e.g. ArcGIS).
     * Shibboleth support: The generated service is opionally protected with the SAML2 Web Browser SSO credentials
 + A library providing bleeding edge functionality commonly missing from the GIS ecosystem, like the generation of INSPIRE compliant View Services / WMSs


To install this web application locally one needs to:
  1) configure the system by editting wsgi/resources/config.ini 
  2) Install apache and configure as follows:
     - set wsgi/igibs.wsgi as a WSGI application
     - set www/htdocs as a document root for static pages
